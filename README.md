This project is part of my Community Action Computing class and focuses on creating 
a dashboard that communicates to users how the shift in vehicle fueling to more sustainable options may be effecting main pollutants.

### The Region 
The data for this project is from California. 
With there being such an increase in popularity in electrical vehicles there, I thought it would be an appropriate one to explore. 

### An Unexpected Story 
I wanted to compare the lifecycle of electric cars versus gas-powered cars.

Like many of my peers, I had heard the argument that "electric cars aren't actually better for the environment—they take so much energy and waste to produce the batteries."

For my project, I wanted to explore this claim: Is it true? What is really better for the environment?

But the story I'm telling today is a different one.

As I began searching for data, I found it nearly impossible to tell the story I wanted to. There was little to no information available about the production of batteries. I looked into specific companies for their carbon emission data, but I found nothing. I researched the most common types of batteries used in electric vehicles and again found no concrete information.

What I did find were a few websites claiming to have it all figured out—and self-reports from electric vehicle companies with no real data.

Hmm...

This situation reminded me of something Dr. Sandra Richter discussed: We often don't see the effects of deforestation and other environmental issues.

It seems that, once again, even in our efforts to become more sustainable, America may be inadvertently hurting developing nations.


### The Data 
I got the data for this project from two main sources:

1. **Vehicle Fuel Type Count by Zip Code Dataset**:  
   U.S. Government, Data.gov. Available at: [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/vehicle-fuel-type-count-by-zip-code](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/vehicle-fuel-type-count-by-zip-code)

2. **EPA Outdoor Air Quality Data**:  
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Available at: [https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data)


### SwD Strategies 
- **Color**: I purposefully set the electric vehicle data to be green throughout the dashboard. 
- **Simple Text**: I kept text minimal in my slideshow, allowing the visuals to take center stage while leaving detailed explanations for my verbal presentation (p. 38).
 **Storyboarding**: Mapping out the flow of my story helped shape the structure of my visualization. This process led me to use a slider to display yearly trends (p. 31-33).
- **Big Idea**: I used this technique to develop a clear thesis and build my three-minute story around it (p. 31).
